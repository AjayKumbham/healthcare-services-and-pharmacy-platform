## 1. Overview

The platform is a modular, enterprise-grade system for healthcare and pharmacy management. It is designed for security, scalability, and maintainability, following industry best practices and real-world healthcare requirements.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

```
[User Browser]
    |
    v
[Frontend (React, Vite, Tailwind CSS)]
    |
    v
[Backend (Java, Spring Boot, REST API)]
    |
    v
[Database (Relational: MySQL/PostgreSQL)]
```
- All communication between frontend and backend is via secure HTTPS REST APIs.
- Backend enforces business logic, security, and data integrity.
- Database stores all persistent data (users, pharmacies, prescriptions, orders, etc.).

## 3. Layer Breakdown

### 3.1 Frontend
- **Tech:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **Responsibilities:**
  - User interface and experience
  - Routing and state management
  - Form validation and user feedback
  - Secure storage of JWT tokens (in cookies/localStorage)
  - API communication with backend
- **Structure:**
  - Modular pages and components (Home, Cart, Admin, Pharmacy, etc.)
  - Context and hooks for state sharing
  - Protected routes for authenticated access

### 3.2 Backend
- **Tech:** Java, Spring Boot, JPA/Hibernate
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Expose RESTful APIs for all business operations
  - Authentication and authorization (JWT, roles)
  - Business logic for user management, pharmacy, orders, etc.
  - Data validation and error handling
  - Email/SMS integration for notifications
- **Structure:**
  - Layered: Controller → Service → Repository → Entity
  - DTOs for API communication
  - SecurityConfig for access control

### 3.3 Database
- **Tech:** MySQL or PostgreSQL (configurable)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Persistent storage of all entities
  - Enforce data integrity via constraints and relationships
- **Structure:**
  - Tables for users, pharmacies, drugs, orders, prescriptions, memberships, etc.
  - Foreign keys for relationships (e.g., user-orders, pharmacy-inventory)

## 4. Data Flow Examples

### 4.1 User Registration
```
User → Frontend (Signup Form) → Backend /api/auth/register → DB (create user, send OTP) → Email Service (send OTP)
```
- User submits registration form
- Backend validates and creates user, generates OTP
- OTP sent via email; user verifies
- On success, user is onboarded and can log in

### 4.2 Order Placement
```
User → Frontend (Cart/Checkout) → Backend /api/auth/placeOrder → DB (create order, update inventory) → Email/SMS (order confirmation)
```
- User adds items to cart and checks out
- Backend validates cart, applies discounts, creates order
- Inventory is updated, order is saved
- Confirmation sent via email/SMS

---

## 5. Security & Compliance
- **Authentication:** JWT-based for all sensitive endpoints
- **Authorization:** Role-based (user, admin, pharmacy)
- **Data Protection:**
  - HTTPS for all API traffic
  - Passwords hashed and salted
  - Sensitive data encrypted at rest where applicable
- **Input Validation:** Both client-side and server-side
- **Compliance:**
  - Designed for healthcare data standards (e.g., HIPAA)
  - Audit trails for critical actions
- **Session Management:**
  - JWT expiration and refresh
  - Logout and token invalidation

---

## 6. Scalability & Extensibility
- **Stateless Backend:** Enables horizontal scaling (multiple backend instances)
- **Modular Codebase:** Easy to add new features or modules
- **API-First Design:** Enables integration with third-party services (e.g., insurance, analytics)
- **Database Optimization:** Indexing, normalization, and connection pooling
- **Cloud-Ready:** Can be deployed on AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-premises

---

## 7. Design Principles & Best Practices
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clear division between UI, business logic, and data access
- **Error Handling:** Consistent error responses and user feedback
- **Testing:** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests (JUnit, frontend testing tools)
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive docs for APIs, features, and architecture
- **Continuous Improvement:** Code reviews, CI/CD pipelines, and regular audits
